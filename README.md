# SmartMaintenance


## Overview
This project focuses on predictive maintenance of water pumps using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict when a water pump is likely to fail, allowing for proactive maintenance to prevent downtime and optimize resource allocation.

## Project Structure
- **Notebooks:** Contains Jupyter notebooks for various stages of the project, including data preparation, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and evaluation.
- **Data:** Stores the dataset used for training and testing the predictive models.
- **Models:** Contains saved model files for deployment or further analysis.
- **Reports:** Stores any project reports, presentations, or documentation.

## Notebooks
1. **data_preparation.ipynb:** Notebook for acquiring, loading, and preprocessing the raw data.
2. **data_preprocessing.ipynb:** Notebook for further preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
3. **eda.ipynb:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook for analyzing and visualizing the dataset to gain insights.
4. **modeling.ipynb:** Notebook for building, training, and evaluating predictive models.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, lightgbm

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and run the Jupyter notebooks in the specified order.
4. Follow the instructions in each notebook to execute the code and analyze the results.
5. Save trained models and any relevant outputs for future reference.

## Further Developments
- Explore real-time data integration for continuous monitoring.
- Collaborate with domain experts to refine feature selection and model performance.
- Deploy models to production environment for live predictions.
- Monitor model performance and update as necessary based on new data and insights.
